Working Remotely – Challenges



Whilst remotely working during the Easter Holidays we faced some challenges which helped us grow in teamwork once we overcame them:

-	Connecting to the meeting from remote devices
-	Organising a time that works for everyone, adapting to last minute changes e.g some people had work shifts that we didn’t account for, so a couple times we had to push our meetings to the very end of the day to allow people to join the meeting after work
-	We all had to get to grips with google meet, which was new for most of us, and for the ones working on Figma, we had to share our screen in order to make changes.
-	The first time we logged onto Figma, it took us multiple tries to work on the same worksheet, as we hadn’t connected them to a team yet. This took up the first half of the first meeting, which meant that we lost some precious time which we had to work back to regain.
-	Issues with Wi-Fi were of course bound to happen, and adapting by turning our cameras off to save broadband
-	It was also more independent work during Easter as we had less access to help from our technicians, Laura and James.
-	Me, Rachael and Clemmie had separate meetings to talk in depth about Figma and how we wanted to design the Figma, taking into account the colours and design, to do this we had to share our screen and all work together in order to work collaboratively
