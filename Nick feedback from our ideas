Sounds good but think about  
Practical making it 
Invite businesses 
Building a website - use figma
Free with email 
Building prototypes and web apps 
Apps are often html ccs and java script 
Often looks the same 
Hes a big fan of paper and pen 
Draw what the vision of interface would look like
Movable and clickable 
Figma is good for that
