Toto Too is an LGBTQ+ charity committed to supporting queer youth in the North East. The organization formed around two major concerns: a growing number of unhoused youth – young people sleeping rough or without permanent, stable housing – coming from LGBTQ+ communities, and a related lack of nuanced mental health support for children and young people. Toto Too is a relatively small, new organization without significant funding, so their focus right now is on 
providing resources and support directly to youth, including identifying safe/welcoming spaces, events, people, and advice. 

They are inspired by the Gay and Lesbian Hotlines of New York and London from the 1970s and hope to bring similar open, non-judgmental, radical information access to new generations in the digital age.Because of legal and ethical concerns around working with young people, Toto Too is extremely cautious about personal data and vetting members. At the same time, they want and need to connect real people. They would like help developing digital tools and/or spaces that support their work safely.
